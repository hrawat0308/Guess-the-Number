# Guess-the-Number
This is a very basic and small game built using Java Script. 
This Game is all about guessing a number between 1 and 20 which is hidden behind the question mark. The game also shows you if your guess is higher or lower than the hidden number, so you can guess accordingly and get a good score in guessing.
